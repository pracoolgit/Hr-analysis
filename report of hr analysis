📘 Project Overview
This project provides a detailed **Human Resources (HR) Data Analysis** using **Power BI**, focused on understanding employee demographics, performance, attrition trends, and workforce distribution.  

The goal of the dashboard is to empower HR teams and management to make **data-driven decisions** related to:
- Employee retention and turnover  
- Departmental performance  
- Workforce diversity  
- Salary and experience analysis  

By visualizing key HR metrics, this dashboard helps organizations identify problem areas, improve retention, and optimize employee engagement strategies.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
| KPI | Description |
|-----|--------------|
| **Total Employees** | Total active employees in the company |
| **Attrition Count** | Number of employees who left the organization |
| **Attrition Rate (%)** | (Attrition Count / Total Employees) × 100 |
| **Average Age** | Mean employee age across departments |
| **Average Salary** | Mean salary across roles or departments |
| **Average Years at Company** | Mean tenure per employee |
| **Gender Diversity Ratio** | Male-to-female employee ratio |
| **Job Satisfaction Score** | Average satisfaction rating (if available) |

## 🧠 Insights & Findings
- The **Sales** and **Research & Development** departments have the highest attrition rates.  
- Employees aged **26–35** show the highest turnover — mainly due to career growth and compensation factors.  
- **Job role and salary** directly influence attrition likelihood.  
- **Work-life balance** and **environment satisfaction** are key factors in employee retention.  
- **Technical roles** have higher average salaries, while **support roles** show higher stability.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboard design and KPI visualization  
- **Excel / CSV Data** – HR dataset for analysis  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Calculated measures and KPIs  
- *(Optional)* **SQL / Python (Pandas)** – Preprocessing or validation  

---

## 🧮 Sample DAX Measures
```DAX
Total Employees = COUNT(HR[Employee ID])

Attrition Count = CALCULATE(
    COUNT(HR[Employee ID]),
    HR[Attrition] = "Yes"
)

Attrition Rate (%) = DIVIDE([Attrition Count], [Total Employees], 0) * 100

Average Salary = AVERAGE(HR[MonthlyIncome])

Average Tenure = AVERAGE(HR[YearsAtCompany])
